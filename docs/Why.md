# Why I Started This Project?

## Purpose

The primary motivation behind initiating this project is to delve deeply into the intricacies of computer science through a singular, comprehensive project. My aim is to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate tasks, akin to the functionalities of a personal assistant. This project isn't just about building something; it's about learning and understanding the breadth and depth of computer science. 

## Approach

I chose to start with a Rust code base because of its low-level capabilities and safety features. Where necessary, I will integrate C and C++ to handle specific tasks that require their strengths. The philosophy guiding this project is that the act of creation should also be an act of learning. Simply creating without understanding can limit our perspective, potentially stifling innovation. This project will serve as a platform to explore and apply core computer science subjects and skills, including but not limited to:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Database systems (both traditional and vector databases)
- Operating system concepts
- Hardware-specific programming
- Advanced AI algorithms, with a core focus on large language models (LLMs) for orchestrating various functionalities including task automation, music generation, and adaptive learning systems.
- Detailed vector operations

## Learning Goals

This journey is dedicated to learning. Each step, each development in the project will contribute to a deeper understanding of computer science and its applications.

# What I Plan to Create?

## Project Overview

The project, named **Rottie**, will be an automation code base designed to function across various platforms including macOS, Raspberry Pi (arm-based), Android, and iOS. 

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Database**: Rottie will feature a dynamic database capable of storing memories and learning from user interactions and environmental inputs.
- **Activity Log**: The system will maintain a comprehensive log of all activities and interactions, which will aid in refining learning algorithms and improving user experience.
- **Training Engine**: An integral part of Rottie will be its efficient training engine, designed to facilitate rapid and timely learning adaptations.
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: The system will be capable of processing inputs in multiple forms â€“ it can read text, listen to audio, and interpret visual data.

This document serves as a living record of both my intentions for and progress on this project. It is a manifesto of learning, a blueprint of creation, and a chronicle of my journey into the depths of computer science.
