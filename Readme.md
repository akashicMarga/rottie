# Project Rottie

## Overview
Project Rottie is an innovative automation codebase designed to function as a personal assistant while exploring deep computer science concepts. Utilizing Rust, the project integrates advanced AI to automate tasks and serves as a platform for learning and applying core computer science principles. it's a hobby project for me to learn CS concepts and build a personal assistant using rust and other low -level languages with hardware utilisation at core.

### Key Features
- **Adaptive Database**: Dynamically stores and learns from user interactions.
- **Activity Log**: Maintains logs of all interactions to refine algorithms.
- **Training Engine**: Facilitates rapid learning and adaptation of AI models.
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Processes inputs in multiple forms including text, audio, and visual data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Operates on macOS, Raspberry Pi, Android, and iOS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Rust and Cargo from [the official site](https://rust-lang.org).
